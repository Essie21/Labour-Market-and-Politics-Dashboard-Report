The Labour Market and Politics Dashboard is a comprehensive analytical tool designed to track employment trends, unemployment patterns, and labor force dynamics across different political administrations in Canada. This dashboard provides policymakers, economists, and researchers with real-time insights into how labor market indicators evolve under different political leadership and economic conditions.

The solution visualizes key metrics including total population, labor force participation, employment rates, unemployment trends, and political party performance across multiple decades of Canadian economic history.

![Labour Market and Politics Dashboard](https://github.com/Essie21/Labour-Market-and-Politics-Dashboard-Report/blob/main/Labour%20Market%20and%20Politics%20Dashboard.png?raw=true)

The dashboard features a clean, data-focused design that correlates national labour statistics with political leadership over time. It provides a macro-level view of how key employment metrics have trended across different governing parties and prime ministers.

Key Dashboard Components:

Primary KPIs: Current Population (12.87M), Labour Force (8.46M), Average Unemployment Rate (8.21%)
Historical Trend Analysis: A line chart visualizing the Unemployment Rate Trend from 1976 to 2021, allowing users to observe economic cycles.
Political Correlation: Interactive filters for Prime Ministers (e.g., Brian Mulroney, Jean Chretien) to analyze how unemployment metrics align with different political tenures.
Partisan Labour Analysis: A "Labour Force by Party" visualization (likely a bar or stacked bar chart) breaking down the labour force composition or performance during the years Liberal and Conservative parties were in power.

## 🎯 Recommendations

1. **Enhance Labour Market Monitoring 📊**
